This is an Android frontend for the excellent ODF Java library called odf2html (formerly JOpenDocument), made by Andi (https://github.com/andiwand/odf2html).
Feel free to use it in your own project too, but please don't forget to tell us about it!

Get the app from Google Play store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.tomtasche.reader)

More information at http://reader.tomtasche.at/ and in the app itself.
